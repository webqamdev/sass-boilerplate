// # Lib entry point

// This file (and its dependencies) is loaded in every Scss file/Vue Component.
// Therefore, it MUST not generate any CSS. Doing so would lead to a massive
// code duplication.
// Only SCSS variables, functions, placeholders or mixins are allowed.

// ## Functions
@import "lib/functions";

// ## Variables
@import "lib/variables";

// ## Mixins
@import "lib/mixins";

// ## Placeholders
@import "lib/placeholders";
