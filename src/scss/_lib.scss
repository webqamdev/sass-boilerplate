// # Lib entry point

// This file (and its dependencies) is loaded in every Scss file/Vue Component.
// Therefore, it MUST not generate any CSS. Doing so would lead to a massive
// code duplication.
// Only SCSS variables, functions, placeholders or mixins are allowed.

// ## Functions
@forward "lib/functions";

// ## Variables
@forward "lib/variables" as var-*;

// ## Mixins
@forward "lib/mixins";

// ## Placeholders
@forward "lib/placeholders";
