/// Outdated browser alert component
///
/// The following code is intentionally minimalistic. Feel free to tweak it.
/// The point here is to hide the component when the browser has a decent CSS support
/// and to keep it visible otherwise (using `@supports`)
///
/// Usage:
/// ```html
/// <p class="browser-upgrade">
///   You're using an outdated browser
/// </p>
/// ```

@use "../lib/variables/theme";

.browser-upgrade {
  background: theme.$color-warning;
  padding: 1em;
  margin-bottom: 0;

  // Consider browsers without support of `@support` rule as outdated (ie. IE11)
  // See https://caniuse.com/css-featurequeries
  @supports (display: flex) {
    // Hide message for decent browsers
    display: none;
  }
}
