/// Workaround for IE11 when using `:hover` and `:focus-within` in the same selector.
/// `:focus-within` is not compatible with IE11. When you use the following selector:
///
/// ```scss
///    .block-selector {
///      &:hover,
///      &:focus-within {
///        color: red;
///      }
///    }
/// ```
///
/// Which compiles to:
///
/// ```css
///      /* Works in every browser but IE11 */
///    .block-selector:hover,
///    .block-selector:focus-within {
///      color: red;
///    }
/// ```
///
/// IE11 which doesn't know this pseudo-class skips it and ignores the whole selector, including the `:hover` part. This
/// mixin aims to address this case by avoid code duplication but split code in distinct selectors so the `:hover` part
/// still works.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```scss
/// .block-selector {
///   @include hover-focus-within() {
///     color: green;
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// compiles to:
///
/// ```css
/// /* Works in every browser */
/// .block-selector:hover {
///   color: green;
/// }
///
/// /* Skipped by IE11 */
/// .block-selector:focus-within {
///   color: green;
/// }
/// ```
@mixin hover-focus-within() {
  &:hover {
    @content;
  }

  &:focus-within {
    @content;
  }
}
